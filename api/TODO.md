You're right, I should provide specific examples from your code and clear explanations on how to fix each issue identified. Here is a tutorial going through each file and code chunk, explaining the problems and how to fix them:

## main.rs

**Issue**: Uses raw SQL queries instead of Diesel ORM

```rust
// Raw SQL query 
let result = diesel::sql_query("SELECT * FROM tasks")
  .load::<Task>(&connection)?;
```

**Fix**: Switch to Diesel's query builder which is typesafe and avoids SQL injection vulnerabilities:

```rust
// Diesel query  
let results = tasks.load::<Task>(&connection)?;
```

**Issue**: No validation on input

**Fix**: Use `validator` crate to validate ID parameter before finding task:

```rust
let id = validate_task_id(id)?;
```

## handlers/tasks.rs

**Issue**: Still uses raw SQL queries instead of Diesel

**Fix**: Switch to Diesel - here is fetching a task by ID:

```rust
use crate::schema::tasks::dsl::*;

let task = tasks.find(id).first::<Task>(&connection)?;
```

**Issue**: Creates User with plain text password

**Fix**: Hash password before creating User:

```rust
let hashed = bcrypt::hash(password, DEFAULT_COST)?;
let user = User::new(username, hashed); 
```

## models/user.rs

**Issue**: Compares plaintext passwords when validating

**Fix**: Use bcrypt's `.verify()` to compare hash:

```rust
if bcrypt::verify(password, &user.hashed)? {
  // passwords match
} 
```

**Issue**: No input validation

**Fix**: Use `validator` to validate:

```rust 
#[derive(Validate)]
struct NewUser {
  #[validate(email)]
  email: String,
}
```

## General

- Add unit and integration tests
- Create custom error types instead of `.unwrap()`
- Use `.env` for configuration 
- Add structured logging with `log` crate
- Split code into modules (lib.rs, models.rs, schema.rs etc.)

Let me know if any part needs more explanation or if you would like to see code examples for other files!


Rust Tutorial (Additional Topics)
User Account Management

    For signup, hash passwords with bcrypt before storing in database. Generate a verification token. Send confirmation email.
    For login, fetch user by username/email. Verify hashed password against stored hash. Return JWT token on success.
    For forgot password, generate reset token. Create reset endpoint that sets new password if valid token provided.
    Use Diesel's schemas and model structs for accounts table. Add email verification/reset timestamp columns.

Role Based Authorization

    Create enum for roles like UserRole { Basic, Admin, Moderator }
    Add role column to users table. Default to Basic on signup.
    On login, include role in JWT claims along with username/ID.
    Before API routes, check claims role and only allow access if permitted.

Input Sanitization

    Use crates like sanitize-html to sanitize user input against XSS etc.
    Call sanitizers before applying any user input like usernames, messages.
    Add sanitization as middleware on API routes rather than each handler.

Deployment

    Configure Dockerfile to build Rust API into an image.
    Push images to container registry like Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
    Deploy containers to Kubernetes cluster on AWS/Azure/Google Cloud.
    Set up CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy on git push.

Logging

    Add log crate and create global logger for app.
    Call error!, warn!, info! etc in code appropriately.
    Support structured logging by passing key-value pairs.
    Integrate with platform like Datadog to store and analyze logs.

Testing

    Write unit tests for modules and functions using #[test].
    Test failing cases - incorrect passwords, invalid IDs etc.
    Write integration tests for API routes using test clients to validate responses.
    Stress test with high load using CLI tools like wrk or k6.

Documentation

    Document functions and structs thoroughly using doc comments.
    Generate API documentation from code comments using rustdoc
    Host docs on service like GitHub pages.

Optimizations

    Add an HTTP cache like libredis for caching route responses.
    Utilize multithreading and async tasks for parallelism using Rayon and Tokio.
    Compile critical paths to WebAssembly using wasm-pack for huge performance gains.
