Let's start with the backend of the application. Here are the core files, classes, and functions we will need:

1. `main.rs`: This is the entrypoint for our backend. It will initialize our Actix web server and set up the routes for our API.

2. `models.rs`: This file will contain the Diesel models for our database tables: `User`, `Task`, and `List`.

3. `schema.rs`: This file will be generated by Diesel and will contain the schema for our database.

4. `auth.rs`: This file will contain the logic for our authentication system, including the `signup` and `login` functions.

5. `handlers.rs`: This file will contain the handlers for our CRUD operations.

Now, let's take a look at the content of each file.
