+Please finish the implementation of this self hostable ticktick app. Make sure to ask questions if needed. 

# 2023-07-17 12:59:01.164064
+For the initial implementation, could you please walk through:
+
+    Setting up the PostgreSQL database connection and configuring Diesel ORM
+    Defining the schema and models for the Tasks table
+    Implementing CRUD APIs for Tasks - create, read, update, delete
+
+We can cover:
+
+    Database connection setup
+    Task model definition
+    Basic CRUD routes/handlers for tasks using Actix web
+    Diesel integration for database access
+    Simple error handling
+
+No need to implement auth or complex logic at this point. We can iterate and expand the APIs incrementally.
+
+Please provide a detailed walkthrough of the steps to:
+
+    Connect to PostgreSQL in Rust
+    Define a Task model
+    Expose CRUD APIs for Tasks

# 2023-07-17 19:31:58.905292
+You're right, those are all important aspects that need to be covered to have a complete backend implementation. Here are some more details on how to approach each one:
+
+**User Model and Authentication**
+
+- User struct should have fields for id, username, email, password_hash
+- Use bcrypt or similar for password hashing
+- Sessions can be handled via JSON Web Tokens 
+- Implement signup to create a new user record
+- Implement login to verify credentials and return a JWT
+
+**List Model and CRUD APIs**
+
+- List struct with id, name, and user_id fields  
+- CRUD routes for lists similar to tasks
+- Connect list endpoints to database queries 
+
+**Associations** 
+
+- Add a user_id field to Task model
+- Add a list_id field to Task model
+- Perform joins in handlers to associate tasks to users and lists
+
+**Input Validation**
+
+- Leverage serializer crates like serde or validator
+- Validate required fields, data types, etc.
+
+**Error Handling**
+
+- Create custom Error structs for each error case
+- Return proper HTTP status codes from API endpoints
+
+**Tests**
+
+- Unit tests for core functionality 
+- Integration tests for API endpoints
+- Use test frameworks like pytest
+
+**Documentation**
+
+- Update README with setup instructions, API docs
+- Include examples of requests and responses

+Is the UI implemented? 

# 2023-07-17 20:04:12.685411
+Here is a tutorial on building a cross-platform app using Rust, WebAssembly, and Flutter:
+Backend in Rust
+
+    Create a Rust project
+    Define backend logic and models
+    Expose API with actix-web:
+
+rust
+
+Copy code
+#[actix_web::main]
+async fn main() {
+  HttpServer::new(|| {
+    App::new()
+      .service(web::scope("/api")
+        .route("/get_data", web::get().to(get_data))
+      )
+  })  
+  .bind("127.0.0.1:8080)?
+  .run()  
+  .await
+}
+
+    Add REST API endpoints
+
+Compile Rust to WASM
+
+    Add wasm target to cargo config
+    Build backend to WASM:
+
+<!---->
+
+Copy code
+cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
+
+3.  Expose JS binding to wasm module:
+
+rust
+
+Copy code
+#[no_mangle]
+pub extern fn process_data(/* args */) {
+  // call Rust function
+}
+
+Flutter UI
+
+    Create Flutter app
+    Install flutter_rust_bridge:
+
+<!---->
+
+Copy code
+flutter pub add flutter_rust_bridge
+
+3.  Call Rust API from Flutter:
+
+dart
+
+Copy code
+import 'package:flutter_rust_bridge/flutter_rust_bridge.dart';
+
+final api = RustWasmApi();
+var result = api.process_data(args);
+
+    Create UI with Flutter widgets:
+
+dart
+
+Copy code
+class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
+
+  // UI code
+
+  @override
+  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
+    return Scaffold(
+      body: // widgets
+    );
+  }
+}
+
+    Navigation, state management etc
+
+Web Frontend
+
+    Create web app with React/Vue/Svelte
+    Load WASM and call Rust APIs
+    Shared UI components
+    Server side rendering
+
+And that's it! The core ideas are reusing Rust business logic across platforms and integrating it with Flutter for UIs. Let me know if you need any part explained further.

+Here are some key features that would be needed for the backend of a TickTick remake:
+
+    User management - User accounts, authentication, profiles
+    Task management - CRUD for tasks, due dates, reminders, recurring tasks
+    List management - CRUD for task lists and folders
+    Tagging - Add tags to tasks to categorize and filter
+    Search - Full text search across tasks and notes
+    Notifications - Push notifications for reminders/events
+    File attachments - Upload and attach files to tasks
+    Collaboration - Share lists and tasks with others
+    Activity tracking - View task activity and history
+    Statistics - Usage statistics and reports
+    Integrations - Calendar, email, third-party service APIs
+    Offline access - Service workers/sync for offline usage
+    Multi-device sync - Sync task data across user devices
+    Security - Authentication, authorization, data encryption
+
+The backend would need to implement robust APIs and data models to cover these features. A combination of technologies like TypeScript/NodeJS, Rust, GraphQL, PostgreSQL/MongoDB could provide high performance and scalability.
+
+Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the key backend requirements!
